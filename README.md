# StudyStream: Making Learning Easier with Educational Videos

## About StudyStream
StudyStream is a video platform built to help students, teachers, and researchers find high-quality educational content without distractions. Unlike YouTube, where educational videos are mixed with entertainment and other content, StudyStream is focused entirely on learning materials.

## The Problem We're Solving
